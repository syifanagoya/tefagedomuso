And then we went and all got in bed. My dad was watching some sort of football game, and my mom opened her presents. And then we went to bed at 8:45.”</p><p>Jenna posted a sweet snap while they were seated at their intimate dinner.</p><p>“Happiest birthday to our darling mama! We so happy to get to spend the night with you just the four of us! We love you so! @laurawbush AND happiest 46 years to our parents. Love you both!” Jenna <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote to Instagram.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Laura also posted a sweet tribute to her daughters and gave a shout-out to Jenna and Barbara’s new book, Love Comes First.</p><p>“My birthday was made all the more special by a visit from our girls!
