Photos taken of the ceremony showed Megan, 28, and Romelu, 30,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> holding hands</a>, an intimate moment of PDA that indicated they were more than just friends. This seemingly confirmed earlier rumors that Megan had split from her longtime boyfriend, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Pardison “Pardi” Fontaine.</strong></a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>While Megan hasn’t shied away from rapping about her personal life and sexuality, the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Grammy-winner</a> has also had to shut down rumors about her romances. She had to shoot down talk about her dating <strong>G-Eazy</strong>, and after Megan was shot in the foot while out with rapper <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tory Lanez,</a>&nbsp;</strong>she first said they were not romantically involved. However, she’d later confirm that they did get sexual while explaining how she was embarrassed over giving her body to the man who shot her. On August 8, 2023, Tory was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sentenced to ten years in prison</a> for the injury, according to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a>, putting a definitive end to the relationship. During the sentencing, Tory said Megan is “someone I still care for dearly to this day,” per legal reporter <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Meghann Cuniff</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>With Meg’s new romance with Romelu heating up, let’s take a look back at the men that Megan Thee Stallion has been linked to thus far in her career.</p><h2>Moneybagg Yo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Megan-Thee-Stallion-Romatic-Timeline-AP-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In July 2019, Megan went public with her relationship with rapper <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Moneybagg Yo,</strong></a> 31. The two collaborated on the song “All Dat,” before seemingly <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>confirming their romance</a> via Instagram Live during the summer of 2019. However, the relationship fizzled out after a few short months, with Moneybagg Yo, born <strong>Demario DeWayne White Jr.</strong>, confirming the split during his January 2020 appearance on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rap Life Radio With Ebro Darden</a>. Moneybagg confessed that the romantic aspect of their relationship simply “didn’t work.” But circumstances between the pair remained relatively amicable.</p><h2>G-Eazy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Megan-Thee-Stallion-Romatic-Timeline-AP-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>In early February 2020, rumors circulated that Megan was romantically involved with rapper&nbsp;<strong>G-Eazy</strong>,&nbsp;after a video of the “I Mean It” rapper, born <strong>Gerald Earl Gillum</strong>,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> licking Meg’s face</a> circulated on social media. Fans were shocked by the potential romance, but Meg was quick to shut down any form of speculation on Twitter. “Lol alright nowww y’all got all y’all jokes out,” Megan began <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her February 2020 tweet</a>, before adding, “but I am not f***ing G Eazy.”</p><h2>Tory Lanez</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Megan-Thee-Stallion-Romatic-Timeline-AP-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>During the summer of 2020, Megan Thee Stallion’s relationship with rapper&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tory Lanez</strong></a> was thrust into the spotlight following the July incident where Tory shot Megan in the foot, and it stayed there until a jury <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>convicted Tory of assault</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>In the early hours of July 12, Tory was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>arrested on a felony count of carrying a concealed weapon</a> in a vehicle. Tory’s arrest came during a traffic stop following reports of gunfire after a party held at Kylie Jenner’s home in Hollywood Hills. Megan was seen getting into a police car with bloody feet. She initially said she had cut herself on broken glass, but would later accuse Tory of shooting her.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“At the time, we are at the height of police brutality,” Megan explained during the 2022 trial over the shooting, saying that after the killing of <strong>George Floyd</strong>, Megan didn’t feel comfortable explaining that Tory had a gun in a car, a gun he used to shoot her. :I felt like if I said this man has just shot me, they might shoot first and ask questions later.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>She would also say in an emotional essay published by<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;The New York Times</a> in October 2020 that she and Tory&nbsp;were not romantically involved. “We were not in a relationship. Truthfully, I was shocked that I ended up in that place.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>During the December 2022 trial – in which Tory would be found guilty of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, having an unregistered firearm in a vehicle, and discharging a firearm with gloss negligence – Megan confirmed she had a sexual relationship with Tory. She also explained why she initially denied it.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>“This whole story was about who I’m having sex with, and I don’t understand why that matters,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she said</a> per Rolling Stone‘s <strong>Nancy Dillion </strong>(h/t <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Cut</a>). Megan explained she was embarrassed. “It’s disgusting at this point. How can I share my body with somebody who could shoot me?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>During the trial, Megan said she regretted coming forward with the shooting. She was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>accused of lying about the shooting</a>&nbsp;and faced misogynistic attacks both online and – in the case of <strong>DaBaby </strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bringing Tory out at Rolling Loud</a> in 2021, right after Megan performed on the stage – in real life. “I can’t even be happy,” she said. “I can’t hold conversations with people for a long time. I don’t feel like I want to be on this earth. I wish he would have just shot and killed me if I knew I would have to go through this torture.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>“You got to be careful what you’re doing in public because sometimes people spin it like it’s something else,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a> in a February 2020 profile. “People think that if I’m hanging out with anybody, it got to be, ‘Oh, they’re having sex.’ Why can’t I just be turnt up with my friend tonight?” Megan has proven to be a formidable presence in the music industry. Regardless of what’s going on in her personal life, fans know that the Tina Snow and Good News&nbsp;hitmaker will keep the hits coming and use her platform to make a difference.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Despite Tory consistently denying that he shot her, the Traumazine&nbsp;rapper has shared <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>screenshots of alleged texts</a> from Tory, where he admits to shooting her. During an April hearing, Tory was handcuffed for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>violating a protective order</a>, telling him not to speak about Megan on social media. The trial was supposed to begin in September 2022, but was pushed to December, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Fader.&nbsp;</a>Finally on August 8, 2023, Tory was sentenced to a decade in prison in Los Angeles. He stated during the sentencing that “the victim’s my friend.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Megan has seemed to reference the shooting in her music. Her track “Who Me?” from her 2022 album Traumazine appeared to have a line about the shooting. She’s also given interviews where she’s spoken about Tory. She described what was happening during <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the alleged shooting</a> in an April interview with&nbsp;<strong>Gayle King&nbsp;</strong>on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS</a>. “I was really scared ’cause I had never been shot at before,” she said.</p><h2>Pardison Fontaine</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/megan-thee-stallion-and-pardison-apnews-ftr.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-19>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Megan’s latest ex is Pardison Fontaine. The singer-songwriter, born <strong>Jordan Kyle Lanier Thorpe</strong>, first confirmed that he and Meg were dating just hours after the “WAP” singer was revealed as the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cover star</a> of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Harpers Bazaar‘s March 2021 edition</a> on February 19.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>“SOMETIMES YOU JUST GOTTA DO THE MOST,” he captioned a Feb. 19 Instagram post, which featured a series of pics and videos. The first clip showed Pardi surprising Meg with a private plane under the guise of the pair going to lunch. “Where are we going?” she asks. It was followed by a snap of the jet covered in red and pink roses and a photo of their February 14 menu which was titled “Pardi With A Hottie.” The final pic showed Megan laying on a bed, wearing a body-con dress, surrounded by rose petals, champagne, and balloons. After Megan won her first Grammy in 2021, she was seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cozying up to</a> Pardi, clearly celebrating her win.</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>However, fans began to suspect there was trouble in paradise in February 2023. They noticed that she wasn’t following Pardi on Instagram, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>XXL</a>. That split would be confirmed in May.</p><h2>Romelu Lukaku</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Megan-Thee-Stallion-Romelu-Lukaku-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-23>Megan and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Romelu Lukaku</strong></a> didn’t announce their relationship with an Instagram post or a tweet, but they seemingly confirmed their new love with a single act of PDA. Megan attended the May 27 wedding of Inter Milan’s <strong>Lautaro Martinez</strong> as Romelu’s date. Meg sat next to Romelu, Lautaro’s teammate, during the reception, and photos showed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her holding Lukaku’s hand</a> afterward. Eyewitnesses shared footage of Meg and the Belgian footballer spending time together, indicating that their love was blossoming.</p><p id=content-paragraph-24>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yenpqmXam1prGMrKuapJyevK95waiwn6qZmrulv4xtamxpYGp%2BcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./steve-owens.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Steve Owens</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./surfer-baby-boy-names.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Aquatic &amp;amp; Surfer Boy Names for Your Beach Baby</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./check-out-ashley-massaros-last-photo-shoot-ever.html>Check Out Ashley Massaros LAST Photo Shoot EVER!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-is-ray-livingston-mud-sweat-and-beards-cast-age-wikipedia-and-wife-details.html>How Old Is Ray Livingston?
