However, those claims were refuted by his representative, Shannon Barr, who <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="told The Hollywood Reporter (opens in a new tab)" href=#>told The Hollywood Reporter</a> he had remained on life support.</p><p>A day after Singleton’s stroke, the “Boyz In the Hood” director was reported to be in a coma. During that time, his mother, Sheila Ward, attempted to become his co-conservator, saying in a court filing that he was “unable to properly provide for his personal needs for physical health, food, clothing or shelter,” Atlanta Black Star previously reported. By contrast, <a href=#>TMZ reported</a> his daughter, Cleopatra Singleton, filed documents stating he was not in a coma and that he was improving each day.</p><p>“My father’s allowed his mother to stay in that position out of fear and obligation to her as she’s bullied and abandoned my father since he was a small child, leaving him emotionally defenseless,” she said in the filing obtained by TMZ.</p><p>As of today, the family, which said the 51-year-old director “quietly struggled with hypertension,” has decided to take Singleton off life support.</p><p>“We are grateful to his fans, friends and colleagues for the outpour of love and prayers during this incredibly difficult time,” the family said further in their statement. “We want to thank all the doctors at Cedars Sinai for the impeccable care he received.</p><p>“John Daniel Singleton will be survived by his extraordinary mother, Sheila Ward, his father, Danny Singleton and his children Justice, Maasai, Hadar, Cleopatra, Selenesol, Isis, and Seven.”</p><p>The statement, which urged people to “please recognize the symptoms [of a stroke] by going to Heart.org,” concluded by noting that memorial service details will be shared “at a later date.”</p><p>In response, fans and celebrities have shared their condolences online.</p><p>“You revolutionized cinema. You nurtured talent. You were so kind. Rest In Peace John Singleton.”</p><p>“Thank you so much for shaping our culture. Rest In Peace.”</p><p>“RIP John Singleton. So sad to hear.
