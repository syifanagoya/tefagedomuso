The 23-year-old fighter revealed he once had suicidal thoughts when appearing on Inside Boxing Live with Dan Canobbio.</p><p>"When deep in it, he didn't think he was going to live." "He developed unhealthy habits and was depressed." Ryan started drinking after never having done so before. But he was constantly intoxicated and, at one point, contemplated suicide. "</p><p>[image-1]</p><p>Garcia dropped out of the fight in April 2021 because of sadness and anxiety, even though he was supposed to fight Javier Fortuna in July 2021. At the time, he stated that he was looking for professional assistance to help him become "a stronger version of myself."</p><p>The unbeaten lightweight admitted to Canobbio that his problems were caused by poor stress management and a lack of a strong support structure, but he is now much better off.

In pictures together, the father and daughter appear so adorable.</p><p>We can categorically state that Rylie is incredibly fortunate to have a father who is so devoted and thoughtful.
