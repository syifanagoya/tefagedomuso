"My mom always gave us them for Christmas and it was a very special treat. I loved them so much."</p><p>Another Wonka bar lover, chimed in: "This was my favorite chocolate bar period. I miss these. My mom used to buy like 5 and wrap them up for me for Christmas."</p><p>A fifth fan replied to the tweet, "No see now I'm mad at you for reminding me about these. My absolute favorite at one time in my life."</p><p>It's clear fans are still devastated by the loss of the chocolate bars, which were first created by Quaker Oats, but after the product was taken off the shelves, Chicago's Breaker Confections launched the Wonka brand in 1976, and it was later bought over by Nestlé in 1988.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>Back in 2005 for Tim Burton’s film adaptation, a Wonka bar was packaged with a Golden Ticket, entitling the winner to a $10,000 cash prize.</p><p>Nestlé sold the Wonka bars in the states until January 2010.</p><p>Then in August 2013, the Wonka Bar returned through Nestlé UK in the following three flavors: Millionaire's Shortbread, Crème Brûlée and Chocolate Nice Cream. However, these chocolate bars weren't sold in the US and were eventually discontinued in 2014.</p><p>Nestlé Australia and New Zealand also introduced Wonka Bars that year, which also got discontinued.</p><p>An explanation on the Nestlé US website states: "We <a href=#>sold the Wonka confectionery brand</a> to the Ferrero Group in March 2018.</p><p>"For more information on the Wonka brand in confectionery, please contact the Ferrero Group."</p><p>The Sun US reached out to both Nestlé and the Ferraro Group for comment but did not receive an immediate reply.</p><p>Back in 2018, the Ferrero group signed a $2.8billion agreement to buy Nestlé's US confectionery business.</p><p>Giovanni Ferrero, Executive Chairman of the Ferrero Group, <a href=#>said in a statement</a> at the time of the acquisition: "We are pleased to welcome Nestlé USA’s confectionary brands and its talented employees to Ferrero.</p><p>"This outstanding portfolio of iconic brands with rich histories and tremendous brand awareness is a strong addition to Ferrero’s growing U.S. platform, which includes the recently acquired Ferrara Candy Company and Fannie May Confections Brands.</p><p>"With our substantially increased scale and broader offering of high-quality products across the chocolate snack, sugar confectionary and seasonal categories, Ferrero is poised for continued growth in the key U.S. market."</p><p>Nestlé USA's confectionary business includes more than 20 iconic American brands, such as Butterfinger, BabyRuth, 100Grand, Raisinets, Wonka, in addition to SweeTarts, LaffyTaffy, and Nerds.</p><p>Meanwhile, people are just realizing what <a href=#>KitKat wafers are actually made of</a> – and it’s answered a year-old question but raised another.</p><p>And here are <a href=#>four fast food desserts</a> customers will never see again.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Also, fans of an&nbsp;<a href=#>exotic Nestlé coffee drink</a>&nbsp;are begging the company to reinstate the product.</p><p>Last year, <a href=#>Nestlé recalled cookie dough</a> due to possible exposure to plastic pieces.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbYFxhJduZ2imlajBrbGMm5ylp6aasW7DzqeimmWTnbyku8uaq55lkpa%2Fbq%2FAp5uyZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-does-it-cost-to-replace-a-starter-in-a-2007-honda-cr-v-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How much does it cost to replace a starter in a 2007 Honda CR V?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jani-thomas-who-is-justin-thomas-mother.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Justin Thomas' mother?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./check-out-ashley-massaros-last-photo-shoot-ever.html>Check Out Ashley Massaros LAST Photo Shoot EVER!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-is-ray-livingston-mud-sweat-and-beards-cast-age-wikipedia-and-wife-details.html>How Old Is Ray Livingston?
