The band gained popularity through their appearances on the Disney Channel.</p><p><strong>The band was formed in 2005, and the brothers’ first song was “Please Be Mine”. The song was used to audition for Columbia Records and sign with the record company. The Jonas Brothers released their first album, “It’s About Time”, in 2006.&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>To learn more about The Jonas Brothers’ rise to success, their split, and their comeback, continue reading.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Beginning of The Jonas Brothers</h2><p>The Jonas Brothers had little success straight from the beginning. They spent 2005, the year they started the teen band, <a href=# rel=noopener>touring around the United States</a> with Kelly Clarkson, Backstreet Boys, and The Cheetah Girls.&nbsp;</p><p>After signing with Columbia Records in 2005 upon presenting their song “Please Be Mine”, the brothers were dropped by the record label in 2007 due to poor sales of their first album. That same year, The Jonas Brothers signed with Disney’s Hollywood Records.&nbsp;</p><p>Their new songs were aired on the Disney Channel, and the first one they released in January 2007, “The Year 3000”, was an immediate success. Throughout 2007, the band recorded covers of Disney Songs and released their second album, “Jonas Brothers”, in August.&nbsp;</p><p>To promote the album, the brothers appeared more frequently on the Disney Channel, including the “Hannah Montana” series where they guest-starred. The brothers also went on a three-month tour in January 2008 to promote their new album.&nbsp;</p><p>The Jonas Brothers continued their acting gigs, and starred in a Disney movie called “Camp Rock” with Demi Lovato in 2008, which <a href=# rel=noopener>increased their popularity</a> and was followed by a sequel. A couple of years later, the brothers even got their own Disney Channel show called “Jonas”.&nbsp;</p><p>After recording four albums, and starring in two movies and their own TV show, the brothers started separating in their music careers and business ventures in 2010. They officially announced the band splitting up due to creative differences in 2013.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Split</h2><p>The band split up in 2013, and while at the time the reason was creative differences, actual reasons came to light a few years later. Nick Jonas, the youngest brother, <a href=# rel=noopener>initiated the split</a> due to poor ticket sales, music they weren’t proud of or enthusiastic about, and a strained relationship among the brothers.&nbsp;</p><p>The split was a disturbance in the family dynamic as the other two brothers, Kevin and Joe, were caught by surprise. They all eventually agreed to go their separate ways artistically.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The brothers’ relationship had become strained over the years of working together</a>, and Nick initiated the split in order to bring peace and repair the family bond they didn’t nurture as much because of business. While Nick turned to progressing his solo career, Joe started another band called DNCE, and Kevin focused on family life and raising his two daughters.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Comeback&nbsp;</h2><p>After 6 years of pursuing separate careers, the brothers announced their reunion in February 2019. The brothers’ first appearance since reuniting was at “The Late Late Show with James Corden” which was also an exclusive into explaining why the reunion happened.&nbsp;</p><p>Nick Jonas explained that their reunion was prompted by the filming of their documentary, “Chasing Happiness”, which was intended to show their lives from the beginning of their careers, to showing where they are today and their solo careers. <a href=# rel=noopener>While filming the documentary and playing a drinking game</a>, the brothers ended up realizing that it is perhaps time to come together and start the band once again.&nbsp;</p><p>The Jonas Brothers released the song “Sucker” in March 2019 which was a huge hit all over the world. The song made it to the first place in the Billboard Hot 100.&nbsp;</p><p>To see the interview with James Corden, click on the link below:&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfmqxdrK60edOhnGain6OutHnBq6atoJWnwG6yyKuqrWWjpLuoew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shakira-looks-20-years-younger-in-new-photos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shakira Looks 20 Years Younger in New Photos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kashena-sampsons-wild-heart-albums-gets-uk-release.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kashena Sampson's 'Wild Heart' Albums Gets UK Release</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./check-out-ashley-massaros-last-photo-shoot-ever.html>Check Out Ashley Massaros LAST Photo Shoot EVER!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-is-ray-livingston-mud-sweat-and-beards-cast-age-wikipedia-and-wife-details.html>How Old Is Ray Livingston?
