However, it was his portrayal of Cato in “The Hunger Games” (2012) that catapulted him to stardom.</p><p>His versatility as an actor became evident as he took on diverse roles, including Shane Patton in “Lone Survivor” (2013) and Dorn in “Bad Boys for Life” (2020). One of his most iconic portrayals was as the legendary Viking, Björn Ironside, in the History Channel series “Vikings” (2014–2020). Currently, he graces our screens with a lead role in the Starz drama series “Heels” (2021-).</p><p>Beyond his acting career, Alexander Ludwig is making waves in the music industry. He released his debut album, “Highway 99,” via BBR Music Group on August 26, 2022, showcasing his musical talents to the world.</p><p><strong>Early Life and Family</strong></p><p>Alexander Ludwig was born to Sharlene (née Martin), a former actress, and Harald Horst Ludwig, a businessman and former co-chair of Lionsgate Entertainment. This charismatic actor comes from a family of entertainers, with three younger siblings.</p><p>Despite his mother’s own experience in the acting world, Ludwig had to persuade his parents to support his acting aspirations as a child. They were cautious, believing that child actors could sometimes lose touch with reality. Nonetheless, his passion for performing and his boundless imagination led the way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmcmsWiusOeqWakpZnEqrOMpqavoZWoeqK6w2arr2Wjnby4v4yhnKKfmKl6urvUp55moZ6owaKz0ZqkZp6RoratxY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cassie-jaye-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cassie Jaye Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./linda-dano-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Linda Dano Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./check-out-ashley-massaros-last-photo-shoot-ever.html>Check Out Ashley Massaros LAST Photo Shoot EVER!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-is-ray-livingston-mud-sweat-and-beards-cast-age-wikipedia-and-wife-details.html>How Old Is Ray Livingston?
