However, with such a sudden rise to fame, many people are wondering who this new Hollywood mystery man is. &nbsp;Since there is no better feeling than having the inside scoop on an up and coming star, here are five things you didn’t know about Michiel Huisman.</p><h2>1. He turned down an offer to pose in Playgirl Magazine.</h2><p>Most guys&nbsp;would jump at the opportunity to pose for Playgirl Magazine. &nbsp;Although Huisman appreciated the request, he decided to turn the offer down. &nbsp;According to Huisman:&nbsp;“I’m very flattered by the attention that some of that has gotten but no, I’m not going to do that. Of course not.”</p><h2>2. He’s also a musician.</h2><p>Aside from being a great actor, Huisman is also a fairly accomplished musician. &nbsp;He was once a singer and guitarist for the Dutch band, Fontane, which released two singles for movies in which he also appeared. &nbsp;after Fontane broke up, Huisman pursued a solo career, and released his first album,&nbsp;<i>Luchtige Verhalen,&nbsp;</i>in 2005.</p><h2>3. He met his wife on a movie set.</h2><p>Huisman has been married to actress Tara Elders since 2005. &nbsp;The couple met on set while filming&nbsp;<i>Phileine Says Sorry.</i></p><h2>4. He’s actually been in the acting world for a while.</h2><p>Although Huisman has just not reached fame in the United States, he’s actually been in the acting business for quite some time. &nbsp;Huisman made his on-screen debut in 1995 during an episode of the Dutch TV series Voor hete vuren.</p><h2>5. He’s never read the Game of Thrones book.</h2><p>Although Michiel Huisman is now a starring character on the popular series, Game of Thrones, he’s admitted that he’s never actually read any of the books.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Skip Bolen/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGikopuYnrKteceuoKylkaN6uLvNrWSbmaKaerW0yKeerGWUnrGvwIykpaivXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-kaillie-humphries-husband-travis-armbruster-american-olympic-bobsledder-athlete-family-and-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Kaillie Humphries Husband Travis Armbruster?
