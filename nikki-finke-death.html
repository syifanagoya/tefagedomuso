Her age was 68.</p><p>On Sunday, her death was posted on the website she started in 2006 and turned into an important source for entertainment news, called Deadline. Finke lived alone for most of her life and died in Boca Raton, Florida, after a long <a href=#>illness</a>, according to a website.</p><p>Finke had a “take-no-prisoners” style that made her both feared and respected in Hollywood. She may be best known for starting stories with the famous “TOLDJA” phrase.</p><p>“She wrote about what she saw in the entertainment business from her own point of view and didn’t mind putting down its biggest stars,” Deadline wrote. “Her often biting, acerbic posts called out wrongdoing and the people who did it, as she saw fit.</p><p>This made her a hero to many assistants and lower-level workers, but it annoyed many in the C-suites who were used to getting nothing but praise.”</p><p>Finke was born on Long Island in 1953. He worked for the Associated Press, Newsweek, New York Magazine, the New York Observer, and the Los Angeles Times over the course of several decades. In 2002, she started writing for LA Weekly’s “Deadline Hollywood” column.</p><p>She started “Deadline Hollywood Daily” in 2006, which was one of the first fast-paced blogs. She once said that she bought the URL for “$14 and change.”</p><p>During the 2007 writers’ strike, which stopped production in Hollywood, she was seen as the best place to get news. The New York Times said that her reporting “solidified her place as a Hollywood power broker.”</p><p>In 2009, she sold Deadline to the media company run by Jay Penske. She left the website in 2013 because of disagreements with him about the content.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-73-965x1024.png><p>“At her best, Nikki Finke embodied the spirit of journalism. She was never afraid to tell the hard truths with a sharp style and a mysterious spark. Jay Penske, the founder and CEO of Penske Media Corporation, said in a statement on Deadline, “She was blunt and honest.” “Working with Nikki was never easy, but she will always be one of the most memorable people I’ve ever met.”</p><p>In 2015, she started the website HollywoodDementia.com, where she and other people wrote and published stories about Hollywood. She is survived by her sister, brother-in-law, and two nieces. The services for her funeral will be private.</p><p><strong>Related Stories Recommended By Writer:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Nikki Finke’s Net Worth As She Dies At The Age Of 68, After Death Earning</a></li><li><a href=#>Bray Wyatt Net Worth: Here’s What We Know About Bray Wyatt’s Total Assets</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX6O2rLfIZp2ippuaeqWxwK2faA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kaitlyn-dever-net-worth-2020-2021.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kaitlyn Dever Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Dating, Kids, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-did-baldwin-hills-gerren-taylor-die-family-details-to-know.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How did Baldwin Hills Gerren Taylor Die?
