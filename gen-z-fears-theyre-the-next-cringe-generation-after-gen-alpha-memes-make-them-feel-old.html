Because I understand why they hate us now,” user Katherine George said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/437f707d371ff4805810ef1de10a557c.png><p>“Gen Alpha jokes aren’t funny, how am I supposed to laugh to a toilet with a head?” another user Isobel said.</p><p>Another user warned that the emergence of Gen Alpha memes on the internet meant Gen Z were “the next cringe generation on the chopping block”.</p><p>“The oldest gen alpha is only 4 years younger than me but I feel ancient,” one person wrote, with another adding they were “scared and confused”.</p><p>Others claimed they were “too young” to feel this old, while some even questioned how the younger generation were old enough to have their own memes.</p><h3 class="inline-module__title headline headline--combo-sm-md">Start your day with all you need to know</h3><p class=inline-module__cta>Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.</p><p><h3 class="inline-module__title headline headline--combo-sm-md">Thanks for signing up!</h3></p><p>However there were some who were defiant, claiming that Gen Z humor was “actually funny” compared to these videos.</p><p>“The difference is our memes were funny I swear,” one person wrote.</p><p>Others even tried to put the blame back on Millennials, many of which are raising Gen Alpha.</p><p>“Nah cuz they were raised by Millennials and it shows,” one commenter said.</p><p>While this new trend may be more than a little confronting for Gen Z, feeling “old” or “out of touch” when younger generations start to grow up is a universal experience for all age groups.</p><p>But while it is a common experience, that doesn’t mean it is any less confronting for Gen Z, clinical psychologist Dr Aileen Alegado tells news.com.au.</p><p>“For Gen Z who are used to being the young ones on the internet, the TikTok masters, having something new and that does not make sense to them trending on the very app they have grown up on, can actually be very confronting,” she said.</p><p>“It’s making a generation whose identity has been wrapped up in being the young ones with the finger on the pulse, realize they may not be that anymore.”</p><p>Dr Alegado said this can lead to a sort of identity crisis, which can create a level of anxiety and confusion and ultimately lead to self-reflection as Gen Z realize they are growing up.</p><p>And just as we saw Gen Z make fun of Millennials for being “cringey”, they are likely going to experience a similar dynamic with Gen Alpha.</p><p>Dr Alegado said when we are part of a group that we identify with and come up against a group with different values, traits and world view, it can create some conflicts.</p><p>“But it’s all in good jest and change is a part of life. Gen Z’s have long laughed at Millennial humor, it is now Gen Z’s turn to have that back at them from a younger generation who see the world differently,” she said.</p><p>As for <a href=#>the trending videos</a> themselves? Well Dr Alegado said this particular trend is hard for “any generation to understand”.</p><p>“But it is a timely reminder that Gen Alpha are on the horizon and ready to show the world who they are,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3FmaWxfnLKvedlmnZ6Zoqh6tbTEsqmeZaSdsm66xLGrZpuinruosYygnKedopbBqrvNZpifrJWneqixzWaYpaiYlnquscyeqmalkaCybsDHnqRmnpWauW67y51m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lancome-singles-day-sale.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lancme Singles' Day Sale Take Up to 30% Off</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./justin-sylvester-biography-age-height-girlfriend-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Justin Sylvester Biography, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./check-out-ashley-massaros-last-photo-shoot-ever.html>Check Out Ashley Massaros LAST Photo Shoot EVER!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-is-ray-livingston-mud-sweat-and-beards-cast-age-wikipedia-and-wife-details.html>How Old Is Ray Livingston?
