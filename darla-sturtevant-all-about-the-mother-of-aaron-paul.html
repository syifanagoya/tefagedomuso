Aaron was delivered through natural birth. Aaron has always found inspiration in Darla. She has helped him in a number of ways, including by enabling him to move to Los Angeles to further his career.</p><p>Aaron was previously a friend of Logan Paul’s, according to him. He claimed that at every event they went, Aaron would come over and shake his hand.</p><p>Logan used to get a pat on the back from Aaron and hear how much he appreciated his writing. However, he said he was stabbed in the back when he responded to Logan Paul’s movie “Suicide Forest” with “Pure Trash.”</p><h2><span id=Mutual_friends_brought_Aaron_and_Lauren_Parsekian_together>Mutual friends brought Aaron and Lauren Parsekian together</span></h2><p>At the 2010 Coachella music festival in Indio, California, Aaron and Lauren Parsekian first met.

Through a contest, they were able to gather $1.8 million, and the victors received passes to the last “Breaking Bad” episode.</p><h2><span id=Bio_of_Darla_Sturtevant>Bio of Darla Sturtevant</span></h2><p>Darla is a senior executive of Townsquare Media and the mother of the American actor Aaron Paul.
