They're perfect for those "I don’t want to think about dressing up" days, these coordinates magically assemble, emitting a deliberate sense of put-together-ness (even if you just rolled out of bed) with lived-in comfort. Doubt their versatility? Don’t.

Aesthetics are coming to the fore, Good American CEO and co-founder Emma Grede points out. “When people think of a traditional sweat set, they think of comfort but not necessarily style," she says. Leisurewear has taken a fashion-forward turn without compromising on ease. “Taking it up a level with fresh fits, silhouettes, and embellishments, the laid-back athleisure aesthetic can have a more elevated feel while making a bold statement.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-everlane-the-retrack-oversized-crew></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane The ReTrack Oversized Crew</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane The ReTrack Oversized Crew" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/WytgsVDKWdNkH81baOEXxV5-TGU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everlane-the-retrack-oversized-crew-9beb4cc012554cf0a2869886fea5646e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Everlane's black matching set, made from recycled materials, combines sustainable fashion with a versatile, soft, and warm cotton blend perfect for various occasions.</p><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>While the relaxed fit appeals to many, it might not resonate with those seeking a snugger appearance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love Everlane’s dedication to conscious craftsmanship, timeless and versatile silhouettes, and price point. Though classic in appearance, subtle touches ensure this ReTrack Oversized Crew sweatshirt stands out, from the dropped shoulders to the voluminous sleeves. Similarly, The ReTrack pants are designed for daily wear, featuring a classic jogger silhouette, an elasticated waistband, an adjustable drawstring, and tapered legs with ribbed cuffs — features that don’t get old. The denser and warmer cotton makes this set ideal for cooler days, as the blend of recycled cotton and polyester ensures a cozy feel throughout. Moreover, Everlane’s signature use of recycled materials not only reflects the brand’s environmental consciousness but also its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Global Recycled Standard (GRS)</a> certification, emphasizing ethical production and sourcing standards — we love to see it.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XL |<strong> Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, recycled cotton, recycled polyester</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Buy the bottoms <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">here</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XL |<strong> Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton (recycled cotton), recycled polyester</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-inclusive-sizing-universal-standard-fiona-open-side-sweatshirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Inclusive Sizing</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Universal Standard Fiona Open Side Sweatshirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Universal Standard Fiona Open Side Sweatshirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/iKqEmQgHEML6ukgu3sVhGTdIl7A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/universal-standard-fiona-open-side-sweatshirt-83844619269a4f07afd4ee62bba4b9cf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Universal Standard</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Universal Standard combines inclusivity with style, offering a cobalt blue set in a wide size range, featuring breathable French terry fabric and practical, comfortable designs.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The wide-leg design of Universal Standard’s sweatpants, while trendy, may not suit those who prefer a more tapered fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Inclusivity in fashion isn’t just a buzzword for Universal Standard; it’s the brand’s ethos. It's renowned for its expansive sizing range and commitment to designing versatile, timeless pieces that always incorporate those trend-forward touches. It’s precisely this dedication that model and entrepreneur Lauren Chan admires: “To know me is to know that I love Universal Standard. The size range, the fit, the fabric quality! So it’s no wonder this Terry sweatsuit is one of my favorite sets on the market,” the model and entrepreneur tells InStyle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The sweatsuit’s cobalt blue hue is in line with color trends this season, giving those who lean towards neutrals an exciting yet not-too-scary color pop. The crewneck pullover, crafted in warm yet breathable French terry, boasts stylish side slits, ensuring a non-restrictive fit. Paired with the equally plush Terry Wide Leg Sweatpants, featuring an elastic waistband that promises no twists or turns, this set epitomizes cozy put-together-ness. A bonus is the deep pockets. “[They] fit a lot — like, TV remote and snacks at home or phone and wallet when out,” Chan says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00–16 |<strong> Colors: </strong>5 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, elastane</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Buy the bottoms <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">here</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00–40 |<strong> Colors: </strong>5 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, elastane<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-tory-burch-velour-colorblock-track-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tory Burch Velour Colorblock Track Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tory Burch Velour Colorblock Track Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/hR-Ps1766CTi6YPgu7WghyAK_DY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tory-burch-velour-colorblock-track-jacket-4cb00ca7afd34e56b563f2390f3fe12a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Tory Burch</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Tory Sport's velour track set creatively combines retro and modern styles, offering comfort and functionality with a unique colorblock design.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The lush velour material may lack breathability, making it less ideal for intense activities or warm climates.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Tory Sport’s Velour Colorblock Track Jacket and Jogger set is giving us Aughts vibes in the best way (a little more polished via the rich jewel tones while drawing inspiration from iconic ’70s track style). Rather than being exact replicas of each other, the two pieces thoughtfully coordinate — the jacket, with its playful colorblock design, and the pants in a solid shade offer a harmonized look with more interest and dimension. The plushness of the velour fabric screams luxury, making it more than a set for lounging but a fanciful option to feel festive around the holidays, helping to justify the splurge-worthy price. Maybe add it to your holiday wish list?

The Accolade Sweatpant presents a not-too-baggy straight-leg design that feels fresh and exceptionally comfortable. Brushed in super-soft French terry, they seem perfect for lounging yet tailored enough to take to the streets. And while the Alo logo provides a subtle nod to the brand’s signature style, it’s the performance tech that truly makes these pants a year-round essential, be it cold weather paired with a puffer jacket or warmer days complemented with slides.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–2XL |<strong> Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyester, wool, viscose</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Buy the bottoms <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">here</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–2XL |<strong> Colors: </strong>6 | <strong>Material:</strong> French terry</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-maternity-old-navy-maternity-half-zip-pullover-sweatshirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Maternity</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Old Navy Maternity Half-Zip Pullover Sweatshirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Old Navy Maternity Half-Zip Pullover Sweatshirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KG8AwRiI81hpaSs4b46Hx8eBw94=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/old-navy-maternity-half-zip-pullover-sweatshirt-6a605f0cef574efcab49573c25721539.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Old Navy</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It combines a bump-friendly waistband with a trendy half-zip mock-neck style, offering both fashion and comfort.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The budget-friendly fabric may wear out faster than pricier alternatives with frequent washing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to maternity wear, finding the perfect balance between comfort, style, and affordability can be a challenge. My recent shopping spree at Old Navy led me to this fabulous matching sweatsuit. In my second trimester, this earthy-toned green combo is everything I didn't know I needed. The sweatshirt’s half-zip mock-neck design combined with the spacious fit makes it my new go-to, especially since it diverges from the common overlap maternity silhouette, which, honestly, isn’t always my first choice. As for the pants, the roll waistband is a dream — it accommodates my bump without feeling constricting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Now, I know not everyone is currently shopping in the maternity section like me, but Old Navy also offers several similar sweatsuits in regular sizing.

Now, I’m eyeing its latest waffle fabric arrivals, the Free Style Pullover and Pant. There's an inherent coziness to this material that doesn't feel stifling, unlike some fleece items in winter can feel when the heat kicks into full blast. Textural coziness aside, the earthy rust color really draws me in — it’s perfect for the season without being overly festive (despite being the hue of the season, I’m not a candy apple red kind of gal). The pullover’s design, ending just at the high hip, beautifully complements the waistband of the pants.

Why? Because I’m often caught in the whirlwind of running after my toddler, and overheating is an all-too-familiar foe. These pieces strike me as the perfect solution: soft enough to relax in yet lightweight enough to keep up with my little one. And I love the A-line shape of the funnel neck, which can accommodate my fluctuating shape during and post-pregnancy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XXXL |<strong> Colors: </strong>5 | <strong>Material:</strong> Acrylic, rayon, polyester, spandex</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Buy the bottoms <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">here</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XXXL |<strong> Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Material:</strong> Acrylic, rayon, polyester, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fleece-aritzia-tna-cozy-fleece-boyfriend-zip-hoodie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fleece</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aritzia Zip Hoodie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aritzia Tna Cozy Fleece Boyfriend Zip Hoodie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/nnIMREb3yULU49gcH2gPLfS-pI4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aritzia-tna-cozy-fleece-boyfriend-zip-hoodie-79287a11048442458b58dc47119d9743.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Aritzia</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Aritzia’s Cozy Fleece set offers exceptional comfort with a perfectly relaxed fit, a unique Vintage Wash for a lived-in feel, and a vast color range for personal style expression.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The unique Vintage Wash may lead to unpredictable variations between pieces.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to achieving the perfect balance of style and comfort, Tna's Cozy Fleece Boyfriend Zip Hoodie and Mega Sweatpant set the bar high. The range of over 30 colors for each piece means you can curate your perfect shade or, if you're like Chan, indulge in multiple hues. “This is my favorite sweatsuit. Actually, I have it in three colors,” she shares. The adaptability of these pieces shines, with Chan noting how she transitions from laid-back looks to dressier ensembles: “I wear them dressed down while traveling, lounging at home, walking the dog, et cetera. And I wear them dressed up for work-ish events and chill dates. My favorite look — with my gray set — I styled with a corset, chain/pearl necklaces, and heels when flying to Miami for the 2023 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit launch.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>2XS–2XL |<strong> Colors: </strong>37 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, polyester (body); cotton, elastane (panels and trim)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Buy the bottoms <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">here</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>2XS–2XL |<strong> Colors: </strong>39 | <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, polyester</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sporty-vuori-sedona-half-zip-womens-fleece-pullover></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sporty</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vuori Sedona Half Zip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vuori Sedona Half Zip Women's Fleece Pullover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dAyW6fBIvA2ordYWuKsyb4aOXMk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vuori-sedona-half-zip-womens-fleece-pullover-20c5631eee9f40b9803f93f525aa7e57.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vuori</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The plush softness of the BCI-certified French terry material, the versatile blue-gray hue, and its sleek, sporty design are perfect for various activities.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> There are only three colors offered, and the price might be a stretch for some budgets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Vuori has firmly established itself in the activewear realm, and the Sedona Half Zip and Jogger — two best-sellers — do not disappoint.

The activewear is among my favorites, but the sweats, mmm, yes, they’re good.

Even after a few spills, it triumphantly emerged from several washes relatively unscathed and retained top-notch quality.

Similarly, the High Waist Sweatpants, designed for maximum comfort, feature an elastic waistband and useful side pockets that I frequently load with my chapstick and a back-up hair elastic. I chose the Large size for a roomier feel (not when pregnant), and I'd recommend the same for those seeking a more relaxed fit. Whether I'm out running errands, enjoying a laid-back day at home, or traveling with my family, I always feel a sense of refined comfort when wearing this set.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-93 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–L |<strong> Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Buy the bottoms <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">here</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-95 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–L |<strong> Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-working-out-athleta-coaster-luxe-recover-sweatshirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Working Out</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Athleta Coaster Luxe Recover Sweatshirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Athleta Coaster Luxe Recover Sweatshirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bNMYgpvzk_G19yPCol5JhOSQSvI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Athleta-Coaster-Luxe-Recover-Sweatshirt-2389703c42044451a9abec431fbb267e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Athleta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The marriage of Athleta's renowned soft, high-quality technical fabrics with a fashion-forward, breathable design in a calming sage green.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> While the roomier fit is great for comfort, it may not suit everyone's style preference for a more tailored workout look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-98 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Athleta has firmly positioned itself as a beloved brand, renowned for its irresistibly soft, high-quality technical fabrics that rise to the challenge of any workout — another one of my favorite labels that has generously gifted various pieces throughout the years to wear-test. Also applause-worthy is the brand's size-inclusive range. This particular set caught my eye, predominantly due to its calming sage green color and lightweight fabric that deviates from the traditional heavier-weight designs of matching sweatsuits.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A thinner, shirt-like crewneck like this one creates a more refined appearance when paired with the Balance Pant — a departure from the ubiquitous activewear silhouettes of leggings and fitted tops. But the real magic lies in the fabric composition. Crafted predominantly from Tencel lyocell, both the sweatshirt and pants promise mega-breathability, ensuring you remain cool and collected while breaking a sweat. But fret not, the breathable quality doesn’t come at the expense of comfort. In fact, the fabric feels so divine that you’ll find yourself reaching for this set not just for your workouts but also for your coziest moments of relaxation.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-100 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–3X |<strong> Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material:</strong> Tencel lyocell, polyester, Lycra</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-101 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Buy the bottoms <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">here</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-102 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–3X |<strong> Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material:</strong> Tencel lyocell, polyester, Lycra</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-quarter-zip-honor-the-gift-14-zip-fleece></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Quarter-Zip</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Honor The Gift 1/4 Zip Fleece</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Honor The Gift 1/4 Zip Fleece" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/szqc6BsXGob2D80OWCt5EykyPx0=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Honor-The-Gift-1-4-Zip-Fleece-a5b401ed80934ee5836d819059e1f0c4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Honor The Gift</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The blend of heavyweight French terry fabric with versatile, modern, unisex designs.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The cropped length and half-zip might not be universally appealing, and the premium price point may raise eyebrows.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-105 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Honor The Gift's recent collection seamlessly balances modernity with comfort. As Kateri Zapp, an in-house stylist for the brand, says, "Our women’s line has a cropped quarter-zip sweatshirt, offering a more feminine take on the classic sweatsuit. It’s not just about standalone style; it's about versatility. These pieces effortlessly pair with skirts, denim, and a range of tops.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-106 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This adaptability extends beyond the women’s line. “For the fashion-forward male, we have a wide-leg sweatpant and matching crewneck. Women too can revel in this trend, echoing the relaxed style many embrace with wide-legged casual pants,” Zapp says. This 1/4 Zip Fleece isn't merely about style; its heavyweight fabric and raw edge detail underscore quality. Paired with the Fleece Sweatpant, featuring custom artwork and premium HTG® woven labels, this set is not just a fashion statement but a testament to refined craftsmanship, making the price tag an investment in enduring style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-107 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–2XL |<strong> Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Material:</strong> French terry</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-108 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Buy the bottoms <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">here</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-109 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–2XL |<strong> Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Material:</strong> French terry</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cashmere-naadam-off-duty-cashmere-hoodie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cashmere</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Naadam Cashmere Hoodie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Naadam Off-Duty Cashmere Hoodie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XQNzHhRcgLOVx7WopESG8-sJArk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Naadam-Off-Duty-Cashmere-Hoodie-7442a20b2855456ebc00fd2265fb65d3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Naadam</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The marriage of sustainable, luxe Mongolian cashmere with timeless designs and trendy touches that Naadam offers.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The premium material can be sensitive to rough handling and might need extra care in cleaning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-112 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There's an unmistakable elegance that envelops you when you slip into a piece crafted from the finest fabrics. Naadam, known for timeless essentials that marry classic with contemporary, has gained popularity in this realm. The brand’s Off-Duty Cashmere set epitomizes this ethos. The Hoodie, a perfect day-to-day staple, presents a relaxed yet classic fit with a versatile drawstring hood and smooth seams that seamlessly blend into any ensemble. Similarly, the Jogger, offering a slimming silhouette accentuated by a drawstring waistband and ribbed detailing, isn't just a regular sweatpant but an elevated one. But what truly makes these pieces stand out is the 100 percent premium Mongolian cashmere they’re crafted from, lending them remarkable softness and luxury. Plus, the brand’s inclusive size range, from XXS to 3X, and the broad spectrum of color choices make it a versatile pick for many.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-113 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–3X |<strong> Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Material:</strong> Mongolian cashmere</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-114 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Buy the bottoms <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">here</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-115 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–3X |<strong> Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Material:</strong> Mongolian cashmere</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-soft-bleusalt-the-turtleneck></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Soft</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bleusalt The Turtleneck</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bleusalt The Turtleneck" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZVgF1-VXaEi5XiURByNzvAhbv0U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Bleusalt-The-Turtleneck-96bb5a115ea04c788d75928ab0485cf1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bleusalt</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The brand’s unmatched ability to channel coastal California vibes with incredibly soft and airy fabrications and sleek yet unexpected silhouettes for loungewear.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> A steeper investment and the pants tend to run long, which might not be ideal for everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-118 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Capturing the laid-back essence of coastal California isn't an easy task, but Bleusalt is one such brand that rises effortlessly to the occasion. Diving into the collection is akin to a caress from the gentle Californian breeze (I’ve tried a few pieces, including the joggers and a maxi dress).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-119 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With this set, the brand deviates from the usual hoodie or crew-neck shirt with a slim-fitting turtleneck. It not only embodies simplicity but offers a graceful drape that sits at the hip, complemented by a vented hem, ensuring no undesired cling. It’s also a great compliment to roomier bottoms like the Cindy Pant after Cindy Crawford’s input and her collaboration. The pants run on the longer side, which is worth noting. However, the true beauty lies in their slim yet fluid cut and subtle flare leg. And with the comfort of an elastic waistband, they offer adaptability — easily paired with a crisp button-down for an elevated look or a hoodie for a more relaxed vibe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-120 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00–6 |<strong> Colors:</strong> 9 | <strong>Material:</strong> Tencel modal, spandex</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-121 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Buy the bottoms <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">here</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-122 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00–6 |<strong> Colors: </strong>9 | <strong>Material:</strong> Tencel modal, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Trends<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Slouchy sweatshirts and tapered pants are quintessentially in the matching sweatsuits realm, but fresh iterations abound this season. “Wide-leg sweatpants are a new trend for both men and women,” notes Zapp. While cropped sweatshirts have recently taken center stage, more “cropped zip hoodies with matching sweatpants” are emerging in various solids, especially “neutrals and browns.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As Grede highlights, the latest sweatsuits come in “vibrant colors, a mix of fabrics, and tasteful embellishments,” ensuring both style and fit. Torres adds that the styling game is changing, too, with sweatsuits paired with “chunky gold jewelry or a fitted button-down shirt” to capture the beloved streetwear-chic vibe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Amidst these changes, the essence of sweats remains unchanged. Chan shares her timeless stance, preferring “standard athletic cotton ones or luxe, finely knit ones,” but isn't averse to embracing seasonal colors.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fit<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The ideal fit for a matching sweatsuit varies from wearer to wearer. However, Zapp says, “A slouchy fit is the ideal,” without compromising the option of layering. Chan emphasizes the role of tailoring in achieving the perfect fit. She points out that while the initial fit around areas like the waist and shoulders is crucial, “the rest can be fixed by alterations.” Many might overlook the idea of tailoring casual garments, but the model's perspective suggests that if you're wearing them frequently, it’s an investment worth making.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With inclusivity at the forefront of more and more brands like Good American, Grede highlights the label’s focus on a wide range of matching sweatsuit silhouettes that embrace all figures, including plus-size and curvy shapes, “ensuring every individual feels both stylish and comfortable without compromise.” Torres echoes this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of personal style over adhering to conventional rules. Recognizing the diversity in body types, she suggests mixing and matching to find the right balance. “If you happen to be smaller at the top and fuller at the bottom, opt for a slouchy crop and easy wide-leg bottom,” she says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fabric<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The fabric of a matching sweatsuit plays a pivotal role in its comfort and appeal. Chan tends towards classic plush cotton for its familiar comfort and the luxury of super-soft cashmere. She also emphasizes the importance of sustainable choices, praising Lenzing EcoVera’s viscose for its eco-conscious properties, stretchability, and ability to wick away sweat. Torres, on the other hand, has a soft spot for French terry, citing its soft feel and durability that resists shrinking and fading, making it ideal for both vibrant hues and timeless dark neutrals.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you style a matching sweatsuit?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Styling a matching sweatsuit has evolved beyond the boundaries of simple athleisure, making room for personal touches and unexpected combinations. Chan shares her unique approach, “It’s kind of like wrong shoe theory: when it finally hits, it hits. One of the ways I come up with ideas is to pretend that it’s a ‘normal’ tailored suit and go from there,” she says, once unexpectedly pairing her sweatsuit with a corset, a chain, pearl necklaces, and heels.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Grede's take revolves around the blend of comfort and style. “The key to styling a matching sweatsuit is all about embracing comfort while adding personal touches,” she emphasizes. Her tip? To stray beyond the expected, such as mixing in statement jewelry or swapping casual shoes for heeled booties. It can even be as simple as switching out your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Apple watch band</a> — chunky metal for sporty silicone. "Balancing proportions is key, especially with sweatpants,” she adds. “Pair looser bottoms with a more tapered top to maintain a casual yet refined look.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Torres and Zapp echo the sentiment of playing with proportions to create a modern aesthetic balance. Torres recommends pairing contrasting fits, such as a “fitted sweatshirt with wide-legged sweatpants,” and suggests layering different fabrics, like a denim jacket, for added texture. Zapp takes a versatile approach, suggesting the classic sporty look with sneakers or a long trench and leather mules for a dressier feel.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Where can you wear a matching sweatsuit?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Where to wear a matching sweatsuit? The consensus tilts towards casual and cozy scenarios. Chan highlights typical places like “home, therapy, and traveling.” But she doesn’t hesitate to venture into unexpected territory, proposing a casual coffee meet-up or a relaxed date setting as ideal places.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, not all settings lend themselves to the relaxed aesthetic of a sweatsuit. Chan warns against wearing them to traditional workplaces, especially outside of the realms of fashion, music, entertainment, or tech. Even within those industries, she suggests a touch of “cautionary judgment.” Torres shares this sentiment, recommending sweatsuits for casual endeavors like “running errands, working from home, casually getting together with friends or long flights.” But she also cautions against them in more formal dining scenarios, as dinners typically require a touch more elegance. While incorporating sweats into workwear is slowly becoming a trend, Torres emphasizes that this works best when combined with tailored pieces to strike a balance.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the most versatile matching sweatsuit?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The most versatile matching sweatsuit hinges predominantly on color and fabric. Chan champions “neutral colors” as the go-to for adaptability, while Torres says materials like “jersey, cotton, knit ribs, sweater, and French terry” offer both seasonality and versatility. Further reinforcing the power of neutrals, she recommends staples in black, white, cream, and brown, noting their effortless transition across varied looks.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Similarly, Zapp emphasizes the adaptability of timeless colors, as they seamlessly pair with various layering pieces and accessories. Her pick is “a black or neutral color, in a cotton blend material, tapered banded bottom that is loose fitting, and either has a matching crewneck sweatshirt or hoodie. These pieces are interchangeable, like denim, shorts, T-shirts, tank tops, jackets, and even skirts.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do matching sweatsuits have to match exactly?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Serious question: Do matching sweatsuits have to match exactly? Quick answer: Opinions vary. For those like Chan, the allure lies in achieving an effortless monochromatic look achieved by exact matches. However, Torres provides a fresh perspective, pointing out how dressing rules effectively don’t exist.
