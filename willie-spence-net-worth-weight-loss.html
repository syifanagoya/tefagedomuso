Spence <a href=# rel=noopener>sang</a> “Diamonds” by Rihanna for his audition piece.&nbsp;</p><p>After his time on American Idol, Spence released more music on his social media platforms.</p><p>As the runner-up, Willie was able to gain a lot of popularity and following from his time on American Idol.</p><p>He has since become a social media sensation.</p><p>He’s also a popular pick on the celebrity shoutout platform ‘Cameo.’</p><p>By giving shoutouts to his fans, Willie Spence has been able to make a significant amount of money.</p><h2><strong>Weight Loss</strong></h2><p>Prior to his audition for American Idol, Willie Spence lost 180 pounds.&nbsp;</p><p>“I weighed 600 pounds,” Spence said on the show.</p><h2><strong>Willie Spence – Net Worth</strong></h2><p>So, how much was Willie Spence worth?</p><p>Most of his income was from his music sales and touring the country, but he also made money from his social media platforms.</p><p>Therefore, at the time of his death, Willie Spence had an estimated net worth of $300,000.</p><p>“I will succeed and go hard for me & my family no matter what,” he said on his <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>.</p><h2><strong>Death</strong></h2><p>On October 11, 2022, Willie Spence died in a car crash.</p><p>He was 23.</p><p>He previously had a flat tire and crashed his Jeep Cherokee into a tractor-trailer while going home to Atlanta from Tennessee.</p><p>“I’m shocked,” Fellow American Idol star Alyssa Wray said. “Still not sure my mind is fully processing this.”</p><p>“I received very tragic news tonight,” Katharine McPhee, who performed a duet with Willie during his American Idol appearance, said on Instagram.</p><p>He is the fifth American Idol finalist to die.</p><h2><strong>The Business of Gospel Music</strong></h2><p>Gospel music is a genre of music that is characterized by its message of hope and redemption.</p><p>The lyrics often reflect the struggles and triumphs of the Christian faith, and the music itself is typically uplifting and joyous.</p><p>Gospel music has its roots in the African-American church, but it has since been adopted by people of all races and cultures.</p><p>Today, gospel music is enjoyed by millions of people around the world, and it continues to be an important part of the African-American experience.</p><p>We bring this up in the context of Spence because he has been known to sing gospel music.</p><p>Other popular artists such as Chance The Rapper, <a href=#>Kirk Franklin</a>, and Kanye West also have ventured into gospel music.</p><p>This genre is very popular and lucrative for artists.</p><p>If Willie continued to produce quality music, there is no doubt that he was able to achieve great success and wealth in the music industry.</p><p>Another avenue he can go down to increase his net worth is by singing at a famous preacher’s event.</p><p>For example, <a href=#>Joel Osteen</a>‘s Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas, has weekly services that are watched by millions of people around the world.</p><p>If Spence were to sing at one of these services, it would bring him a lot of exposure and could potentially lead to more opportunities and higher earnings.</p><h2><strong>Marketing Lessons From How Willie</strong></h2><p>With strong family values and an inspirational story, Willie was a likable guy.</p><p>We want to support people that we like.</p><p>It’s a natural way he markets himself, and his story can be heard through his voice.</p><p>This connects him to his fans in a special way.</p><p>It’s important to be relatable to your target audience.</p><p>Spence was able to do this because he is a regular guy who has gone through regular life experiences. However, he has also achieved something great by making a name for himself in the music industry.</p><p>This makes him an aspirational figure for many people.</p><p>When marketing yourself or your business, it’s important to find that balance between being relatable and aspirational.</p><p>You want people to be able to see themselves in you, but you also want to show them that it’s possible to achieve their dreams.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Heavy Young Heathens Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Final Words</strong></h2><p>Spence was a rising star in the music industry.</p><p>His net worth was estimated to grow significantly in the coming years.</p><p>He was best known for his unique style of music, which combines elements of R&B, pop, and hip-hop.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong> <a href=#>What is DJ Ballistic’s net worth</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfrLatuMieZKyolaOwpnnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal51p6goKCkYrmwv9Jo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-widow-meet-the-cast-itv.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meet the cast of ITV's The Widow</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-angelique-boyer-all-about-her-age-height-net-worth-and-husband-616820-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Angelique Boyer?
